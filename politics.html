        <h2>New Presidential Candidate Law</h2>
        
        <p class="a_desc">
            No longer are the times when a president has to be 35 years or older. <br>
            If the people want someone who happens to be younger, than they deserve that person as president. <br>
            This new change allows anyone to be president regardless of their age.
